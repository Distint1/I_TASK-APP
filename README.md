# TodoList APP 

Why do we need a TodoList App deployed on blockchain, because of its confidentiality and security, its erased the fear of your vital data getting leaked, 
like your durg prescription for a particular health issues or data that involve your wealth.

This app is to showcase the use of WEB3.0, in replacing the WEB2.0, this todlist app has three functions 
AddTask,
GetTask, and 
DeleteTask

It stores the data in the euthereum blockchain, the advanced stage of this project will involve storage on infura IPFS, because the use of blockchain can be 
very expensive due to the gas amount needed for each task(transaction). 

So the primarily aim of the project is to showcase that WEB3.0 can confidently replace WEB2.0.


This project demonstrates a Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
